Simple prototype for Doris android application based on genandroid.
The models are : 
- model/DorisAndroid.ecore for the persistency data structure
- model/DorisAndroid.genandroid for the view defintion and mapping with the datastructure

The generated code uses tags that allow embedding custom code in several places. look for tags like : 
		//Start of user code 

		//End of user code
